About
-----
A simple iOS app written in Swift that selects a random option from a list of options.
I wanted to jump right into Swift and port an existing application I had written in Objective-C. 
As you can see when browsing the source, the app only contains 3 files so it isn't too difficult
to follow. I'm curious what can be improved upon. This is my first crack at Swift so be nice :]

To-Do
-----
- Error handling
- Better animations
- Testing, in general...

Usage
-----
iOS 8, Xcode 6 Beta
